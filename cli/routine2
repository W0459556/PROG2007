<h4>Submission of Work</h4>
<p>Late submissions will receive the standard late submission penalty as
stated in the course outline. (10% overall deduction per day late, until 60%,
or up to 4 days)</p>
<p>
You will submit your .py file and flowchart(s) for this assignment via GitHub. While you will
have frequent commits/pushes of your assignment code to GitHub as you work
on it, the instructor needs to know which version to mark and when it was
committed.
So, when you have completed all assignment work, put a "Ready for Marking"
comment on the last code committed into GitHub. Then submit a simple text
document to the Brightspace Dropbox that contains the git Commit ID string
(e.g., "b180b37") that identifies that commit. It is this Dropbox submission
that will be used to determine late penalties, so make sure to do so prior
to the assignment deadline.

<h4>Evaluation</h4>

The rubric contains the criteria your instructor will be assessing when
marking your assignment.
