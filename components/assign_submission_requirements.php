<h4>Submission of Work</h4>
    <h5>Video Recording Submission:</h5>
    <p>
    You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a video screen-capture recording of you using
    CLion, GitBash, and viewing your code to show completion of the Video Submission Checklist, which is
    posted on Brightspace. You will post either your video file or a link to it (e.g. a Microsoft Stream
    recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 1
    Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice
    from the instructor prior to the deadline. <br /> <br />
    <strong>
        NOTE: MAKE SURE TO SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE VIDEO SUBMISSION CHECKLIST STEP-BY-STEP. YOU WILL NEED AUDIO
        IN THE VIDEO FOR AT LEAST THE CODE REVIEW PORTION OF THE CHECKLIST
    </strong>
